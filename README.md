# CreateSwiftly
Algorithmic Questions in Swift, iOS Development, and Swift Basics. 

## Background 
Last year in April, I noitced a few things while I was doing my own personal deep dive on Swift: 
(1) No one really created iOS interview questions, using Swift langauge, instead often just translating from Java ignoring the nuiances swift gives you. 
(2) Concepts around iOS often seem convoluted in online tutorial and often very hard to digest for beginnings. 

This is to help hopefully straighten some of the things out, in a clean organized way. It will start with some of my code from previous years I have worked on, and as I go through interview (wihtout naming names) I will add iOS interview questions & answers to here. 

My hope is to sort these out enough as I plan to make an iOS interview course, because honestly, there aren't many resources for that niche, and its highly desire (and most high school studnets are actually learning Swift suprisingly).
