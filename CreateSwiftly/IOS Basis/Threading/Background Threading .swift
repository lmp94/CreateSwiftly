// MARK: - Foundational Notes & Nomeclature

// There are four different groups of activities we use for threading, these are detailed
// by inidicating the QoS (Quality of Service) based on:
//
// (1) how quickly it needs to be procceed (priority)
// and/or
// (2) the expected throughput:

// - .userInteractive: work that must be processed instantly
// - .userInitiated: work that almost instananeous (< a few seconds)
// - .utility: work that can take some, but should return in a reasonable amoutn of time, i.e. API call.
// - .background: work that could/ will take a long time
